# Rapid watched-key presses

Patch `0049-watched-key-press-queue.patch` fixes missed rapid presses in the
runtime's watched-key API, including the game's F1 mod-menu toggle.

Raylib's `IsKeyPressed` compares the previous and current held states. When GLFW
processes a key-down and key-up in the same input poll, both states can be up and
that comparison misses the press. GLFW still puts the original key-down event in
Raylib's keycode queue. The runtime now counts those events once per poll.

This changes genuine input handling; it does not synthesize keys or change game
memory. Held keys do not count again without a new key-down. Two distinct taps
retain a count of two, preserving the menu's existing toggle parity.

The compiled game and runtime have no other `GetKeyPressed` consumer. The ImGui
backend uses held/released key state and the separate `GetCharPressed` character
queue, which this patch does not consume or modify. A future keycode-queue
consumer would need to share this collection point.

The patch does not change held gamepad controls, Escape handling, or the menu's
existing Ctrl+F1 exclusion. It has no dependency on character skins or renderer
changes.

## Validation

After applying the normal runtime patch sequence, run from an MSVC developer shell:

```powershell
python tools/test_watched_keys.py --runtime-source PS2Recomp/ps2xRuntime/src/lib/ps2_pad.cpp --build-directory "<external build directory>"
```

The test extracts the actual collector from the patched source and compiles it
against controlled event queues. Cases cover ordinary presses, held keys,
same-poll press/release, distinct rapid taps, unrelated typed characters,
unavailable windows, empty queues, and the unchanged Ctrl exclusion. It does not
start a game or window.

In the actual native game, the same rapid automated F1 taps that previously had
no effect opened and closed the existing mod menu after this patch. Mouse input
and menu interaction remained available. No character-mod behavior is needed
for that check.
